## Problem Statement
## KPIâ€™s REQUIREMENT
We need to analyse key indicators for our Supply Chain data to gain insights into our business performance. Specifically, we want to calculate the following metrics:
1.	Total Revenue generated: The sum of Revenue Generated
2.	Total Orders Quantity: The sum of Orders_quantity
3.	Total Availability: The sum of Availability
4.	Total Stocks Levels: The sum of Stocks_levels
5.	Total Lead Times: The Sum Of Lead_times

## Data Analysis using MySQL
Utilized MySQL for data extraction and calculation of key metrics such as Total Revenue Generated, Total Orders Quantity, Total Availability, Total Stocks Levels, Total Lead Times.
